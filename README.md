The application displays "Tweets" cards, and the Home page shows the total
number of cards and the number of cards that are subscribed to.

The subscription state is stored in local storage using Redux persist.

The application implements routing and card filtering.

The backend part of the application is written since mockapi.io requires payment
and does not allow registration for a free project!

The backend part is hosted on render.com -
https://goit-test-backend.onrender.com.
